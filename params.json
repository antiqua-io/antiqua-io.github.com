{"name":"Antiqua","body":"### Welcome to Antiqua's Grave\r\nAntiqua was a way to archive private GitHub repositories so that you could free up space and save a little bit on your monthly bill.

Since it wasn't a successful project in terms of user adoption, I'm open sourcing it under the MIT license.\r\n\r\n### Attributions\r\nSee:\r\n* [https://github.com/cookrn/Antiqua/blob/master/public/humans.txt](https://github.com/cookrn/Antiqua/blob/master/public/humans.txt)\r\n* [https://github.com/cookrn/Antiqua/blob/master/Gemfile](https://github.com/cookrn/Antiqua/blob/master/Gemfile)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nBuilt by @cookrn\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble understanding or running Antiqua?
